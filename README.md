An Online Restaurant Reservation Platform

## High Level Project Description

The project is a reservation platform for restaurants. Used by both customers and restuarant owners.

## Project Description

The project is a reservation platform for restaurants. There will be two type of users, customers and restaurant/business owners. Both of which will have their own separate account portal once they signed up for an account on the website. For customers, they will be able to browse through restaurants displayed on the platform (basic restaurant information) and make a reservation through the website's system. Customers will then be able to see their list of made reservations (including past reservations) on their account page. For restaurant owners, once they log in to the system,they will be able to see and manage reservations made at their diners.

## Project Task Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

1. Browse through a selection of premade restaurants on the website's home page (displayed like cards)
2. Display information of each specific restaurant (introduction, contacts, location, food pictures) in a separate page once the user clicks on its card on the home page
3. A functional reservation system 

### Standard Requirements

1. Account sign up for both customers and restaurant owners and appropriate portal page for them once they log in.
2. Two factor authentication when users sign up for accounts
3. Customer users are able to cancel reservations up until a certain time before reserved date
4. Ability for new restaurant owners to sign up for accounts and input relevant information regarding their restaurant. After which, the platform will parse the info and make a corresponding listing to be featured on the home page.

### Stretch Requirements

1. Basic business analytics tools for restaurant owners when they log in (eg. data visualizations on the number of reservations made in a certain time frame)
2. A corresponding waitlist system so that last minute cancellations on the reservation system will be automatically filled.
3. Possible payment system in which reservations can be prepaid with purchase of tickets
